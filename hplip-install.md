Slackware default installation should have all the dependencies necessary for HPLIP.

Some generous soul at Microlinux created a recent package that worked perfectly:

    # hp-setup

That will configure your printer. For print mode and other settings, click on the HP System Tray icon and select "HP Device Manager". 

Enjoy!
