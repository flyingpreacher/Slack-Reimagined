# Slack-Reimagined
####My Personal Repository of Slackware Installation and Configuration

With this repository, I intend to save all documents, code examples, and code snippets I used to Install and Configure Slackware Linux. 

Some of it may not make sense to you, or you may have a different system configuration. This is <b>just a guide</b> for what you can do with your own personal Slackware install.

I am going to start with a lot of HOWTOs. Then I plan to write docs (edited of course) so that someone can use it on their own computer. 

That's it for now. 

Enjoy!
