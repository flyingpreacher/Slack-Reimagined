####Configuring Fonts
Install webcore-fonts from sbopkg.
1. It took me a long time to install these fonts because I could not figure out how to make sbopkg.conf file accept my designation for SBo-git -current.
2. I realized that I had to put it into the /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf because it was not working in the ~/.sbopkg.conf. I cannot run sbopkg from my user account, so I have to login as root to do it. Even though I have added myself to the sudo group. That is strange. Maybe after a reboot, we will try again.
